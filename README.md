## ðŸš› Logistics Analytics Dashboard | Power BI + Python

This project is a complete Logistics Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI and Python.  
It provides a 360-degree view of logistics operations by converting raw, simulated datasets into actionable insights.  
The data was generated in Python, structured in CSV format, and modeled in Power BI using DAX for key metrics.  
The dashboard covers 10 major logistics areas including fleet operations, route optimization, shipment tracking, inventory forecasting, and predictive models.  
Each page is fully interactive, featuring slicers, KPI cards, gauges, charts, and navigation for seamless analysis.

Key highlights include tracking over 1,000 vehicles, analyzing â‚¹5.15 million in logistics costs, and reporting an on-time delivery rate of 90.78%.  
DAX calculations power predictive indicators like failure risk and delay estimation.  
The dashboard helps identify inefficiencies such as high maintenance load, rising fuel costs, and supplier delays.  
Its clean layout and real-time visuals make it ideal for supply chain monitoring and strategic decision-making.  
This project demonstrates how data visualization can drive smarter logistics through centralized, data-driven storytelling.
